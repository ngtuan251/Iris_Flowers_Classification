# __Iris Flowers Classification__

In this project, I will develop data preprocessing and modeling pipeline using Python libraries to classify iris flowers among three species.

I will implement six different supervised learning algorithms in order to achieve the model with highest classification accuracy.

It helps me a lot to understand the core steps to do an end-to-end Machine Learning project.
